Hello! Welcome to the LyandOS documentation. Here you can get some info about the OS. It is written in C# using the Cosmos Kernel.
What you can see in the OS:
- simple calculator
- UTC clock
- ability to shutdown and restart the computer with the command
- portability (no installation required)
- the installing and deleting of programms
- file manager
- color customization
That's all for now. OS version: 0.0.5. I hope that the OS is usable!
